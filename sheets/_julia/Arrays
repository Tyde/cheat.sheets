# Arrays in Julia are 1-indexed
# gives you the length of an array
# If the array has multiple dimensions, it returns the length of the longest dimension.
length(a)

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # creates a simple one-dimensional array
a = Array{Float64}()  # creates a 0-element Float64 array (one-dimensional)
a = Array{Float64)(5) # creates a 5-element Float64 array (one-dimensional)

a[3] = 5 # sets the third(!) value of the array to 5
i = a[3] # read elements
